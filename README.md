# Emergency and Disaster Management Domain Working Group
The mission of the Emergency and Disaster Management (EDM) DWG is to improve efficiency and effectiveness of users in all phases of emergency and disaster activities communities through changes and extensions to OGC Standards, which result in interoperable geospatial products and other information consumables that can be shared across these communities.

Please [join the EDM DWG mailing list](https://lists.ogc.org/mailman/listinfo/EDM.DWG) to stay up-to-date on group activies and post questions for this community of experts.



# 1. Introduction and Background

Since OGC's inception in 1994, the OGC standards development process has been heavily influenced by the needs of the emergency management / response, Homeland Security and disaster management communities working to advance standards for improved information sharing, situational awareness and decision making. Many of OGC's working group activities, testbeds and pilot initiatives have been driven by requirements and use cases provided by representatives from these communities. Examples include:

- Wildfire monitoring and response (OGC Web Services, Phase 2)
- Cross Boarder Critical Infrastructure Protection (Critical Infrastructure Protection Initiative Phase 1)
- Severe weather event response and recovery (OGC Web Services, Phase 3)
- "Dirty Bomb" incident in an urban center (OGC Web Services, Phase 4)
- Monitoring, forecasting and warning of landslide / debris flow events (OGC Web Services, Phase 6)

Geospatial information and techologies along with OGC and complimentary open standards are being increasingly leveraged in major research and operational programs involved in emergency and disaster planning, early warning, prevention, response and recovery.

- ORCHESTRA ( **O** pen A **RCH** it **E** cture and **S** patial Data Infras **TR** ucture for Risk M **A** nagement) was funded by the European Commission within the 6th Framework Programme and served to design and implement an open service-oriented "info-structure" for risk management and at developing services that use this info-structure.
- Global Monitoring for Environmental Security (GMES), a joint initiative of the European Commission and the European Space Agency, seeks to bring together the needs of society related to environment and security with the advanced technical and operational capability offered by terrestrial and space and airborne observation systems. Both data integration and information management play a paramount role.
- SAFER (Services and Applications For Emergency Response) was funded by the European Commission within the 7th Framework Programme and served to implement preoperational versions of the Emergency Response Core Service. SAFER will reinforce European capacity to respond to emergency situations: fires, floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, humanitarian crisis.
- In the USA, Homeland Security activities focus on three primary aspects: Prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce America's vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage from potential attacks and natural disasters. DHS standards policy emphasizes the use of open voluntary consensus standards in DHS programs nationwide.
- With respect to disasters and emergency situations, a goal of the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS) is to integrate Earth observations with other information to help planners reduce vulnerability, strengthen preparedness and early-warning measures and, after disaster strikes, rebuild housing and infrastructure in ways that limit future risks
- In Canada, GeoConnections has been leading and facilitating the Multi-Agency Situational Awareness System (MASAS) initiative. This initiative is using standards based technologies to improve the exchange of emergency incident information among official emergency management agencies in Federal, Provincial, and municipal jurisdictions, with the objective of improving situational awareness for all participants.
- Early Warning and response activities are underway in the Asia/Pacific region to address events such as Tsunamis, earthquakes, debris flows, floods, and drought. Project such as the German Indonesian Tsunami Early Warning System (GITEWS), Sensor-based Landslide Early Warning System, Taiwan Debris Flow Sensor Grid are just a few examples.
- Through programs such as UN-SPIDER and UN-ISDR, the United Nations supports a range of programs dedicated not only to disaster response, but to minimize/prevent loss of life and livelihood as a result of disaster events.

OGC has also formalized alliance partnerships with several standards and professional organizations to improve our ability to advance standards in support of this community. Standards partnerships with IETF, OASIS, W3C and others have resulted in improved handling of location in standards like CAP, EDXL-DE, and Hospital Availability Exchange (HAVE). OGC alliance partnerships with organizations such as the IJIS Institute, the ISPRS, and COMCARE are fostering collaboration between OGC membership and the broader justice, public safety and homeland security domains in identifying and addressing priority standards requirements.

The EDM DWG will serve as a single point of discussion for interoperability standards, best practices, reference architecture, and user requirements related to emergency and disaster management to assure that important topics are identified, discussed and acted upon to meet the needs of the community. The DWG will place emphasis on the user and their institutional challenges in collaboration, information sharing, risk analysis, forecasting / prediction, and decision making.

The EDM DWG supersedes the Risk and Crises Management Working Group which was chartered in March of 2005.

# 2. Purpose

## 2.1 Purpose

The purpose of the EDM DWG is to promote and support the establishment of requirements and best practices for web service interfaces, models and schemas for enabling the discovery, access, sharing, analysis, visualization and processing of information to the forecasting, prevention, response to and recovery from emergency and disaster situations.

The scope of work will span all phases of emergency and disaster management:

- **Prevention and Mitigation** is a long-term, on-going process which anticipates the type of events that might occur and attempts to create a complex heterogeneous framework or mechanism composed of people, organizations, technology, data, information and policy etc. that is capable of minimizing the impact of a emergency or disaster event. Mitigation is not static. It is a dynamic, evolving process that continually takes input from the other three other stages (preparation, response and recovery, see below) and uses the results of past episodes as the basis for improving the mitigation model through lessons learned.
- **Preparation** is the process of preparing for an imminent event. In this phase the mechanism that has been modeled in the prevention phase is activated and the script which has been developed during mitigation begins to be executed. Depending on the nature of the event the time frame for preparation may be weeks, days or simply a matter of minutes.
- **Response** is the required reactive action to an event. The nature of the event will define the characteristics, duration and spatial extent. However, there are certain principles that can be expected in this phase. Effective, efficient communication will be at a premium and there will be a need to deliver complex, synthesized, accurate information in an environment that is constrained in both time and resources. The response phase will also vary in time and extent based on type. Toxic spills and explosions for example, constitute focused events that are often constrained in both time and space. At the other end of the spectrum are forest fires, droughts and flooding that may occur over great expanses of the landscape and be trans-border and last for months on end.
- **Recovery** includes humanitarian relief in the aftermath of the event. This phase is often a media focus and is played out on the news. In many instances the public's ultimate measure of the success of all the preceding phases will be based on the effectiveness with which this phase is implemented.
